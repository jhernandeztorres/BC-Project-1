# Destination Unknown
Destination Unknowm is a site built with HTML, CSS, JQuery and it uses a couple of API's. After the origin and destination locations are entered a webcam of the origin and destination will appear to show how the area is looking at the moment. Then it will show you what are the prices that other customers have paid for their flights, when they were bought, and how far in advance.
